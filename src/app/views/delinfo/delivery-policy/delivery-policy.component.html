        <h2>Delivery times</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Deliveries are made Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays) from 8.00am to 5.00pm.<br><br>
            Deliveries are on a next day basis on orders placed by 4.00pm. All orders placed after 4.00pm will be
            treated as having
            been ordered the following day. Orders placed on a Friday before 4.00pm will be delivered Monday or the next
            working day
            if Monday is a public holiday. All orders placed online on a Saturday or Sunday will be processed on Monday
            for delivery
            on Tuesday.<br><br>
            Delivery of some items may take 2 to 7 days or even longer period. These items will be clearly marked on our
            site. Items
            are delivered either by our own delivery staffs or by our approved delivery contractors. In either case, a
            signature is
            required to acknowledge receipt of goods.<br><br>
            Delivery can take place anytime between 8.00am and 5.00pm. A specific delivery time cannot be supplied.
            Deliveries may
            actually take longer than our usual timeframes due to unforeseen circumstances.
        </p>
        <h2>Partial delivery</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Your order may be delivered in one or more lots depending on the availability of the items ordered and the
            planning of
            our logistics resources. However, if at the time your order is being processed we note that one or more
            items are not
            available and cannot be delivered within the next 3 working days following your order, we shall contact you
            immediately,
            either by mail or by phone, to propose you to cancel the unavailable item(s). Any decision to wait until we
            receive the
            missing item(s) will be at your own risk. In any case, waiting period cannot exceed 7 working days from the
            date of your
            order. If you have ordered an item which, for any reason, cannot be delivered within the maximum waiting
            period of 7
            working days, we shall withdraw the order for that item and shall inform you accordingly. This does not
            concern Oversize
            items and Special Orders for which the waiting period can be longer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Available items will be delivered within our usual delivery timeframes. Invoices will be raised only for
            items which
            have been delivered.
        </p>
        <h2>Free delivery</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Delivery is free for orders of Rs 2,000 (excluding VAT) or more to established Free Delivery Zones. This
            excludes items
            classified as Oversize for which an Oversize Delivery Charge is applicable.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Free Delivery Zones include Main City Areas namely Port Louis, Beau Bassin, Rose Hill, Eben Cybercity,
            Quatre Bornes,
            Vacoas, Phoenix, Curepipe and some other areas. At the time of registration you will be informed whether you
            are
            eligible to our Free Delivery Zones policy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            If your delivery address is located in a Free Delivery Zone and your order is less than Rs 2,000 (excluding
            VAT), you
            will be charged a small delivery fee of Rs 100+VAT.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            For deliveries to areas outside the Free Delivery Zones you will be charged a delivery fee of Rs 200+VAT for
            an order of
            any value (excluding items classified as Oversize).
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            A nominal handling fee of Rs 100+VAT applies to all orders but handling fees will not apply on replacement
            orders or
            returned items.
        </p>
        <h2>Please note</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Free Delivery Zones, Main City Areas and their respective suburbs are subject to reclassification from time
            to time.
            A street address is required for delivery. P.O Boxes cannot be used as a delivery address.
        </p>
        <h2>Oversize delivery</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Oversize items require extra handling and take longer to transport. Because of this, additional handling and
            delivery
            fees apply to all products classified as Oversize. To check whether or not the product you are ordering is
            subject to an
            Oversize Delivery Charge, please look for the ‘Oversize’ icon.
        </p>
        <h2>In Store pickup</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            DelOffice does not currently have any store where you can pick your order. All orders are delivered at your
            door.
        </p>
        <h2>Express delivery</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            DelOffice understands that it may happen that customers need one or more items urgently. An Express Delivery
            Service is
            available but is subject to the availability of the product(s) ordered and logistics resources at the time
            of request.

        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            An Express Delivery Service is a delivery within 3 hours as from the time of our confirmation to your
            request for an
            Express Delivery. Once we receive an Express Delivery Order, a team member will contact you via your phone
            number as
            listed in your contact details to confirm whether the Express Delivery Service can be provided or not. If a
            team member
            has not contacted you within 30 minutes of sending your request, please contact us on <u>249-3200</u>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            An Express Delivery Service requires extra attention and resources. For this reason, an Express Delivery Fee
            of Rs 500
            applies to all deliveries in the Free Delivery Zones and Rs 800 for other areas for an order of any value.
            There is no
            Express Delivery Service for items classified as “Oversize”.
